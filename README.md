Community Funded Science

## Abstract
Knowledge is embedded and owned in the culture which produces it.

In a market driven economy, the production of knowledge in every sector is driven by the company which funds it.
To bring the responsibility of knowledge production back to the Community, or humanity itself, we propose a community governed foundation.

Based on a block-chain based voting system, this project builds a world-wide pot, where financial resources are gathered.

Within this voting-system, researches can be voted published and voted for- or against. Research groups may apply to examine the knowledge which is demanded by the community.
