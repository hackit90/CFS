Community Funded Science
“A block-chain based foundation which is owned and led by its community.”

## Abstract
Knowledge is embedded and owned in the culture which produces it.

In a market driven economy, the production of knowledge is driven by companies who try to get ahead their competitors.
While this may lead to innovation and grow in an economy, certain sectors will get short on attention.
If something is not profitable or able to patent, it will not be researched because nobody will pay the scientist to do it.

As men evolved to an agricultural lifestyle certain inventions lead to higher production and output. Due to this innovation, only 9 people were needed to fulfil the work of 10.
The saved worker was set aside, to find other ways of improvement. 
At this moment, the concept of university was born and scientists were supported and funded by their society.

Blockchain technology allows to build a foundation which is owned and led by its members. People contribute to the network in donating capital and engaging in the voting process.
Every participant is allowed to propose projects, which needed be researched.
The whole community then votes for the projects, which then will be funded.

Scientists and universities will be working for the foundation without any conflict of interest.
«Parallel encapsulated research» will bring independent results while variation in search-results needs to be cleared out, in order to get the full amount of the salary.
Projects will be funded in stages.

## Example: «Parallel encapsulated research»
Three groups get the approval to do a certain research.
Three different scientist get the task to control the results.
30% of the money, approved by the foundation, will be retained in the foundation.
When the research results are presented, the control group is going to work on it.
If there are faults or opposite conclusions, the control group will publish these.
After a defence round of the research group, the network will decide if the research-group or the control group was right and who is getting the 30%, which was retained.
