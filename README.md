Community Funded Science
“A block-chain based foundation which is owned and directed by its community.”

## Abstract
Knowledge is embedded and owned by the culture which produces it.

In the past, when man evolved to an agricultural lifestyle certain inventions lead to higher producitivty. This resultet in only 9 out of 10 people being required to cover the needs of the community. This one person who was rendered obselete, could then spend his time in improving the lifes of all further trough thinking work. This work that would produce further innovations and improvements for all, was covered and financed by his fellow man. 
At this moment the concept of a university was born where scientists were supported and funded by their society.

Today, in a market driven economy, the production of knowledge is driven by profit. A company or a society try to have an economic edge compared to the competition.
While this certainly leads to innovation and growt in an economy, and consequently society, certain topics or sectors are ignored.
If something is not profitable or able to be patented, it will not be researched because nobody will pay the researcher to do it.

This shortcomming of todays research could be minimized with modern methods emulating past ideas.
The blockchain technology would enables the building of a foundation which is owned and led by its members. People contribute to the network in donating capital and engaging in a voting process.
Every member is allowed to propose projects, i.e. research questions, which could be researched.
The whole community then votes for the projects, democratically selecting which will be funded.

Scientists and universities will be working for the foundation without any conflict of interest.

## Example: «Parallel encapsulated research»
Three groups get the approval to do certain research.
Three different scientist get the task to review any results.
Up front, only part of the funds are released, to ensure that research costs are covered.
When first results are produced these are presented to the independent peer review process.
If there are incompatible conclusions or questionable results, the peers can present these.
The researchers can then defend their results and further elaborate.
Finally the network will decide which reaserch group was in the right based on the decision the rest of the funds could be released.

«Parallel encapsulated research» will produce independent results which can further increase research output trough meta studies as well as verfy the results, increasing trust in the results and process. 

Projects will be funded in stages.
